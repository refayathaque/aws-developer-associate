                <h2>What is Lambda?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>All we have to worry about is our code, AWS takes care of everything else for us</i></li>
                    <li>Compute service where we can upload code and create a <strong>Lambda function</strong></li>
                    <li>Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that are being used to run our code</li>
                    <li>Do not have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc.</li>
                    <li>Lambda can be - <strong>Event driven</strong> compute service where it is run in response to events - E.g., change to data in S3 or DynamoDB table</li>
                    <li>Lambda can be - Compute service in <strong>response to HTTP requests</strong> using API Gateway or through API calls from AWS SDKs</li>
                    <li><strong>Independent - 1 event = 1 function</strong></li>
                    <li><i>Can also trigger other Lambda functions</i> - <strong>1 event can = x functions, if functions trigger other functions</strong> - E.g., an event can trigger one Lambda function which in turn triggers 3 other Lambda functions</li>
                    <li>Can interact with many other AWS services/resources, e.g., persisting data into a DynamoDB table</li>
                    <li>AWS classifies it as <strong>'compute service'</strong>'</li>
                    <li>Is part of the <strong>'serverless'</strong> realm along with: <i>API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB</i> - RDS/EC2/Elastic Beanstalk are not 'serverless'</li>
                    <li>Lambda architectures can get extremely complicated, use X-Ray to debug</li>
                    <li>Can do things <strong>globally</strong> (not stuck in one region) - E.g., we can use it to back up S3 buckets into other S3 buckets</li>

                    <li># Requests - First 1 million requests are free, $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter</li>
                    <li>Duration - Calculated from time our code begins executing until it returns (i.e., terminates) - Rounded up to the nearest 100ms - This pricing also depends on the amount of memory we allocate to the function - $0.00001667 per Gb-second used</li>

                    <li>No servers</li>
                    <li>Continous Scaling - No need to configure Auto Scaling Groups like with EC2 - Scales out (not up) automatically, e.g., we can have millions of functions running parallelly</li>
                    <li>Super cheap</li>
                    <li>Amazon Echo works with Lambda - When we use Alexa we are speaking to AWS Lambda</li>
                    <li>In the console we can see a list of AWS services/resouces the function has access to by virtue of the <strong>role</strong> assigned</li>
                    <li>You can define Environment Variables as key-value pairs that are accessible from your function code - These are useful to store configuration settings without the need to change function code</li>

                    <li>Each function version has a <i>unique ARN (Amazon Resource Number)</i></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>After initially creating a function ($LATEST), we can publish a version 1 of it</li>
                    <li>By creating an alias named <strong>PROD</strong> that points to version 1, we can now use the PROD alias to invoke version 1 of the function</li>
                    <li>We can then refactor the code ($LATEST) and publish another stable and improved version (version 2)</li>
                    <li>We can promote version 2 to production by <strong>remapping</strong> the PROD alias so it now points to version 2</li>
                    <li><i>If we find something wrong with version 2, we can easily roll back the production code to version 1 by remapping the PROD alias so it now points to version 1</i></li>
                    <li>Split Traffic - Using aliases to different versions - Adds up to 100% - <strong>Cannot split traffic with $LATEST, instead create an alias to $LATEST</strong></li>
